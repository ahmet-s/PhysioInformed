Good. Now, I want to explain treatment options we have for your situation but there is no best option that goes for everyone. We'll briefly go through the each option with their possible advantages and disadvantages for you. So, if you can reflect on them, we can find the best one that suits you. How does it sound to you?

Okay. So, if we sum up the situation, your pain started 6 months ago{focusTopicNames ? _Onset: and we don't know the exact reason}. {focusTopicNames ? _Radiation: No radiation from shoulder.} It's getting worse /**ExerRelFac**/especially when lying on it or lifting. /**WorkOut**/Quitted an already limited working out routine due to a previous back injury{focusTopicNames ? _MedHist: but no other health problems or medication used}. Finally you {focusTopicNames ? _SocHist:live alone and} worried the situation can interfere with your work{focusTopicNames ? _WorkCond: in which you don't stress your shoulder except driving long hours}.
